      My favorite beverage is water. Water can do it all. The human body would
      not be able to survive without water after a few days, maybe up to a week
      in some rare cases. Our bodies are made up of about 70% water because it
      performs essential functions ranging from thermoregulation to waste and
      nutrient transport. Water's molecular composition and polar covalent
      bonding lends to its unique properties. And if that wasn't enough, it's
      zero calories!
